# raspberry-pi-pico
Code for Raspberry Pi Pico projects

## reaction
Based on the reaction game in "Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico".

I've added a second game which is reaction in reverse - instead of pressing the button the fastest after a light goes out, you have to press your button the closest to the time before a timer runs out, but with the timer set randomly for each player.
